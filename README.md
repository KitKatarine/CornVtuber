# CornVtuber

This is a SIMPLE Corn Vtuber Model for use with applications that can run .moc3 models (such as Facerig and Vtube Studio). 

What you get: 

- The .moc3, .cmo3, both JSON files (corn.cdi3 and corn.model3), as well as the original .psd file AND the original .kra file (for use with Krita image program)

- basic left right tracking, eyes blink, mouth open and close, mouth smile and frown.

What you DON'T get: 

- toggles
- physics
- up/down

This was just a little fun thing to do, that I am now offering for the general public. If you want to add to it, GOOD. If you want to change it, GOOD! I included all the files, go hog-wild! 
If you use it, you can credit me on Twitter/X @gm_kitkatarine!
